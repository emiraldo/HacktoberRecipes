Place the eggs in a saucepan just large enough to hold them all in one layer. Add water to cover by 1 1/2 inches. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Partially cover the pan and bring to a full rolling boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and leave on heat for 30 seconds. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes. Pour off hot water and rinse eggs under cold running water for 5 minutes. Pour off the water and shake the pans to crack the eggs. Peel under cold running water.

Cut peeled eggs in half lengthwise. Transfer yolks to a bowl. Cover and chill yolks and whites separately for 1 hour.

In a large bowl, mash the yolks with a fork. Mash in the mayonnaise and 1 tablespoon Sriracha Sauce. Taste and add more Sriracha Sauce until mixture reaches desired spiciness. Add ground mustard; stir until well blended. Salt to taste. If needed add a little more mayonnaise to add more moisture to mixture.

Place the egg yolk mixture in plastic sealable bag. Cut a small corner out of the plastic bag. Squeeze the yolk mixture out of the corner of the bag to fill the egg white halves. This will help the eggs look cleaner. Cover and refrigerate.

When ready to serve, garnish the tops of each deviled eggs with minced chives and a drop or two of Sriracha Sauce.
