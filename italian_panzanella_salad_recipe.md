* 1 tablespoon capers, drained
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 to 3 anchovy fillets, diced**

* 1 cup red onion, thinly sliced

* 1/4 cup Kalamata or Nicoise olives, pitted
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces
* Coarse salt and freshly-ground black pepper to taste
* 1/4 cup freshly-grated Parmesan Cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano)

## Instructions 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Adjust oven rack to middle of your oven.

Spread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet in a single layer; dry in oven approximately 10 minutes; remove from oven and set aside and let cool to room temperature.

Gently toss prepared tomatoes and teaspoon salt in large bowl.  Transfer to colander that is set over bowl; set aside to drain for 15 minutes, tossing occasionally.  Reserve the drained tomato juice in case you decide you need it in the salad dressing or for another recipe.

Using a mortar and pestle, mash the capers, garlic and anchovies until you have a smooth paste.  Place in a large bowl.

Whisk the olive oil and balsamic vinegar into the anchovy paste until combined.  Add some of the drained tomato juice, if desired.  Add the toasted bread cubes and toss thoroughly.  Add tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, red peppers, yellow peppers, olives, basil, coarse salt, and pepper.  Toss the ingredients gently to coat. let marinate in a cool place (not the refrigerator) for 1 hour or longer so all the flavors can mingle and the bread becomes permeated with the juices of the tomatoes.  Do not refrigerate or you will destroy the texture of the tomatoes.

Before serving, toss the salad gently and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top.

Makes 12 cups.
